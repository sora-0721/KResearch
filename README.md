## About The Project

KResearch is a sophisticated research assistant designed to tackle complex topics by leveraging a multi-agent AI system. It automates the process of in-depth research by planning, executing, and synthesizing information from the web. The final output is a comprehensive, well-structured report complete with source citations and a visual knowledge graph, making it an invaluable tool for students, analysts, and anyone needing to quickly develop a deep understanding of a subject.



### Key Features

*   **Conversational AI Agents**: Utilizes 'Alpha' (Strategist) and 'Beta' (Tactician) agents who collaborate to create an optimal research plan.
*   **Iterative Research Cycles**: Performs multiple cycles of planning, searching, and reading to gather comprehensive insights.
*   **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visualizes the AI's entire thought process in a detailed, step-by-step timeline.
*   **Configurable Research Modes**: Offers 'Balanced', 'Deep Dive', 'Fast', and 'Ultra Fast' modes to tailor the research process to your needs.
*   **Comprehensive Final Report**: Generates a well-structured final report in Markdown, synthesizing all findings.
*   **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Automatically creates a Mermaid.js graph to visualize key entities and their relationships.
*   **Sourced Citations**: Grounds all research using Google Search and provides a complete list of sources.
*   **Modern & Responsive UI**: A sleek, glassmorphism design built with React and Tailwind CSS, featuring light and dark modes.

### Built With

*   [React](https://react.dev/)
*   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
*   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   [Google Gemini API (`@google/genai`)](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-js)
*   [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/)

## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up and running the KResearch application locally.

### Prerequisites

You must have a Google Gemini API key to use this application.
*   **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtain from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation

This project is a static web application and does not require a complex build step.

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/KuekHaoYang/KResearch
    cd kresearch
    ```
2.  Serve the project folder using a local web server. Here are two common ways:
    
    Using Python's built-in server:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    
    Or using the `serve` NPM package:
    ```sh
    npx serve .
    ```
3.  Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by the server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`).

## Configuration

The application requires the Google Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project (if your serving method supports it) or ensure the `API_KEY` is set in the environment where the application is hosted.

```dotenv
# .env file
API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
```

The application code directly accesses this key via `process.env.API_KEY`. You must ensure your local server or deployment environment makes this variable accessible to the frontend code.

## Usage

Once the application is running in your browser:

1.  **Select a Research Mode**: Choose from 'Balanced', 'Deep Dive', 'Fast', or 'Ultra Fast' depending on the desired depth and speed.
2.  **Enter Your Query**: Type your research topic or question into the main text area.
3.  **Start Research**: Click the "Start Research" button or press `Enter` (without `Shift`).
4.  **Monitor Progress**: Observe the research log as the AI agents work. You can stop the process at any time.
5.  **Review Results**: Once complete, the final report, knowledge graph, and citations will be displayed. You can copy the report text to your clipboard.
6.  **New Research**: Click "Start New Research" to clear the results and begin again.
